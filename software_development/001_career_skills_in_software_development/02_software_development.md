## Software development

Software development involves various processes related to software design, development and delivery. Recall, software is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do
## Different Types of software
#### 1. System Software 

Provide core function such as operating systems or hardware management (Windows, Linux, Android, etc.)
#### 2. Application Software

Help users perform a specific task (e-commerce web application)
#### 3. Programming Software

Gives programmers the tools they need to create code
## The Software Development process 

#### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 

Software is developed in various phases known as the software development life cycle or SDLC. known as the software development life cycle or SDLC. This process allows companies to produce software of high quality in a timely efficient manner.

### There are seven phases of the SDLC.
  
1. Requirements gathering. This is where certain members of the software team work to understand what is needed by users and the business. They may conduct interviews, hold workshops, or research competitors to provide the direction for the project. 

2. Analysis. This is where team members begin to focus on the portion of the requirements that they plan on implementing. Identify any risk to the project's success and document the high level goals. 

3. Design. This is much more than what a user might see on the screen. This is the system's design of how the various components will fit together. You can think of it as a blueprint for the programmers to use during the next phase,

4. Coding. In this phase, programmers start to build the software by writing code using the chosen programming language. It is typically the longest phase of the software development life cycle. 

5. Testing. We don't build cars and just put them on the road. That would be disastrous. Once we build software, we don't just give it to users. Instead, we make sure it's tested. During this phase, bugs or defects are found During this phase, bugs or defects are found and communicated to the programmers. They then work to fix the bugs and have them retested. This process continues until the software is bug free. 

6. Deployment. The software is now available to users. They might download it in a mobile app or access it online via website.

7. Maintenance. Now that the software is in user's hands, additional bugs may need to be fixed or minor adjustments made. The way customers use the software is not always the same as how the team envisioned it. Therefore, it's normal to make updates from time to time after software has been deployed.

## The various roles in software development

The software development cycle has several phases. In each phase, one or two key roles drive it forward. 
#### The development team.

Stakeholder. As the stakeholder, he is accountable for the project budget, direction, and its ultimate success. As a result, he has a considerable influence on what features the team develops.

Team's Product Manager, or PM. As the PM, she works with the stakeholder to define the user needs and set the product roadmap. She also works closely with the programmers and designers to deliver features.

The designers. They work as the User Experience and User Interface Designers, respectively. As the User Experience Designer, he is responsible for ensuring the software we develop is user friendly. In addition, he does user research and stays up to date on the latest guidelines for human-computer interaction. In comparison, the UI designer works to provide the styles, graphics, and user interface elements needed by programmers.

The Programmers. This team has three programmers. They each specialize in various layers of the system. First up, is the front-end programmer. He handles what the users see and interact with. Then there's the backend programmer. She focuses mainly on the software rules known as business logic. And finally, full-stack programmer, they can write code for any system layer. 

Quality Assurance Engineer. Is responsible for ensuring the quality of the software that is developed and tests the software under various conditions and ensures it behaves as expected.

## Tools used for software development

A tool can be used for each phase of the software development life cycle. I'll walk you through the most common tools you're likely to encounter starting out. 

The whiteboard. A whiteboard is great for brainstorming ideas, visualizing project components, and collaborating on a problem with others. I don't think I've ever been to a tech company's office that didn't contain several whiteboards. Even if you work on a project virtually, you can still use online whiteboards to get the same benefits. 

Online collaboration software. Companies like Microsoft, Google, and Atlassian provide software that allows a team to collaborate on files together. This is vital for software projects, as requirements need to be documented, systems need to be represented visually, and presentations need to be created for stakeholders, and much, much more. Being able to collaborate on these files as a team is critical. 

Project management software. This allows the product manager to plan software projects and keep them on track. If you think about an app that you use every day, it's no doubt made up of several screens with lots of actions that you can take. Keeping track of each screen, button, and action could get complicated. The project management software allows you to define each task of a project, assign it to the appropriate person, and monitor the time it takes to complete. Depending on the size of your project and the company's budget, your project management software can have relatively few features or be highly configurable. Programmers rely on the project management software to help them identify what they should work on next. 

Integrated development environments, or IDEs, are used by programmers to write code for the project. Similar to project management software, IDEs can be simple or come with numerous features to aid a programmer in developing software application. 

Paper and pencil. I keep a notebook on my desk that I use to sketch simple designs, jot ideas, and outline system interactions before I begin development.

## Getting software to customers

Once software is up and running, the next step is getting it to customers. This is one of the most critical aspects of the software development process. 

If you can't get the software in users' hands, your project cannot succeed. Worse yet, you fail to adequately protect your software, and it's copied illegally and distributed to non-paying customers. In either case, all of your hard work would've been for nothing. Delivering software to the intended users is known as software deployment. The type of application developed dictates the steps followed during the deployment process. 

During deployment, the code written by the programmers is packaged, tested, and released, so that the desired customers can use it. I've had the pleasure of developing both web and mobile applications. For modern web applications, the deployment process is highly automated. It could look something like this. 

![[study_drive/software_development/0_imgs/Pasted image 20240807021646.png]]

The programmer writes new code. The new code is tested, and no bugs are found. Then the code is packaged into the existing project. And then a new executable is produced. An executable is a file or program that computers can run. This executable is then copied to the internet. From there, users can go to the website's URL and benefit from the programmer's changes.

Compare this to a typical mobile application. The process is often a mix of automated and manual steps. The programmer writes new code, and before the chosen deployment date, the code is packaged into the existing project. A new executable is then produced. Next, the new executable is given to the tester. The tester manually checks that the recent changes didn't introduce any bugs. Once that's done, the executable is copied to an app store. App stores help protect the executable from illegal copying and provide a mechanism for delivering the changes to users. 

And whether it's a web or mobile application, Doesn't stop once customers have the software. The development team will monitor the success of the project based on the actions taken by customers. They will also work to fix any bugs they discover once the software is fully deployed. By investing in a streamlined software development process, companies can respond to customer needs quickly and stay competitive in an ever-changing world.
