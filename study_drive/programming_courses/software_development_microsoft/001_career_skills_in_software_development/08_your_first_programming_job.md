Before you start applying to jobs in tech, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the process. There are multiple steps involved, which are often referred to as the hiring funnel. 

The hiring funnel is typically composed of the following, the resume review, the recruiter phone screen, the tech phone screen, and finally the on-site. 

Resume or CV review. The goal of this stage is to market yourself and get an interview. Depending on the size of the company, your resume might be reviewed by the recruiter, the hiring manager, or even software. Some companies use automated resume screening software to help them hone in on the most relevant applications. Since this is the first stage of the funnel, you'll want to spend time getting your resume just right. I'll be sharing my tried and true tested tips on how to create the ideal resume shortly. 

The second stage of the hiring funnel is the recruiter phone screen. This is where you aim to show the recruiter that you are a good fit for the company. You'll want to make sure you've done some preliminary research on the company, but where can you start? I recommend the following. The company's official "about us" page, articles on their blog, their social media accounts, and public review sites. You want to impress on the recruiter that you have a sincere interest in the company and would be a valuable contributor. 

Moving on the tech phone screen. This is where you get to highlight your technical skills, your problem solving ability, and once again, your interest in the team. The technical phone screen is often conducted by a potential future colleague. 

Let's move on to the final stage, the on-site. Your goal at this point is to land the job. During the on-site, which could take place either in person or online, you typically meet with several people from the company. Only a small number of applicants make it to this stage, so when you get here, make the most of it. 

Be personable and come prepared, ask in advance what the structure will be, who will be involved in the various interviews, and what their role is in the company. This will ensure you feel comfortable and can be yourself. We walk through the hiring funnel. You're now ready to start building up your technical portfolio and resume.

## Building up your technical portfolio

When you're just starting out in the tech industry, it can be intimidating applying for programming jobs. When I was first starting out, I worried about how I could compete with little to no real world experience. You might be worried about the same thing. Let me share with you a few techniques for building up your technical portfolio. One of the simplest ways to get started is by working on sample projects. Sample projects are small coding tests that give you the opportunity to demonstrate your skills with a given technology. Here's some of my favorite projects. 

A Recipe app. This project will allow you to showcase navigation, going from a list to a detail screen or even persistence, if you add the ability to save your favorite recipes. 

A ToDo List. You can find countless examples of to-do list in various languages online. The ToDo app is great for basic create, read, update, and delete functionality. 

A simple online game. Snake is a popular go to, Snake is a popular go to, as the graphics are minimal and the gameplay simplistic. Next up, contributing to open source. This can be a rewarding way to learn and build up your portfolio since all of your open source work is public.

You can reference it as proof of your skills to any future employer and many open source projects set aside tasks specifically for beginners. This allows you to contribute small changes that make a difference. How do you know which projects are looking for help? 

I recommend searching on GitHub for any of the following labels. Help wanted, good for beginners or good first issue. Help wanted, good for beginners or good first issue. You'll find a listing of projects that are looking for help and tend to be welcoming to first timers. Moving on to internships.

Internships can help you gain valuable work experience. They allow you to apply your newly acquired knowledge to real work. Internships can also help you to stand out among your competition as interns typically require less training and can handle more responsibilities than someone with no prior work experience. 

And the final way you can build up your technical portfolio, doesn't involve coding at all. And that's by means of a personal blog. There are numerous blogging platforms available for free. Blogging shows that you know how to communicate effectively in writing. But what could you write about? Here are some of my personal go-to blogging topics. Learning something new, setting up a sample project, overcoming a technical challenge, takeaways from an online event or conference. 

We've looked at creating sample apps, contributing to open source, internships, and now blogging as ways you can build up your technical portfolio. Don't feel like you have to do them all at once or even at all. Take your time, enjoy the process. If you do, you'll be on your way to landing your first job in tech.

## Writing your résumé

The resume or CV review is the first stage of the hiring funnel. Typically, for entry-level programming positions, you may have to compete with hundreds of other applicants. The goal of this stage is to market yourself and get an interview. You can successfully market yourself by making sure you include relevant projects and work history, you document the technologies and libraries that you're familiar with, and you keep it succinct and metrics-focused. Let's look at an example to see how this can be done. 

We're going to work on a resume for an entry-level Android programmer. They're applying for a job as a junior Android developer. Here's a snippet of the job description. We'll use this to help customize their resume. 

Let's start with the Skills section. We'll want to make sure it includes the skills mentioned in the job description. It goes without saying that you shouldn't lie on your resume. Only include a particular skill if you actually know about it. In their case, we can add familiarity with the Kotlin programming language, dependency injection and unit testing. 

Work experience. One of the best ways to structure the bullets in your work experience is to use this formula.
I accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z. 

Let's see an example. First, the wrong way. 

- "Contributed to transforming our app into modules." 

This is a factual statement, but it's boring and doesn't give the reviewer insight into why this matters. Instead, try: 

- "Transformed our Android application into modules by introducing dynamic features. This lowered our build times by 35%." 

Much better. When you formulate your bullets, use words that have power and grab the reader's attention, like sustained, coordinated, orchestrated, acquired, spearheaded. 

All of these words really help your resume to stand out. And now for a pro tip: add your GitHub handle and LinkedIn URL to provide the reviewer with a more well-rounded view of you and your accomplishments. 

Sharing your GitHub handle will allow you to showcase the projects in your technical portfolio. While you're LinkedIn URL can highlight endorsements, recommendations and honors you've received. When you put this advice into action, you are well on your way to securing a job in tech.

## Preparing for technical interviews

The technical interview is the phase of the hiring funnel, where you get to show off your programming skills. It usually comes with a coding challenge in order to gauge your aptitude for the work.

There are three typical flavors of tech interviews these days. The first is the algorithm exercise. This is where you're asked a question that relies on your knowledge of data structures and complexity. This is most common during the beginning of your career. 

Next, you have the take-home coding challenge. As the name implies, you're asked to complete a coding exercise but you may have a day or two to finish it on your own. As an example, I once was tasked with writing an API for online news articles for a take-home challenge. 

And finally, there's the live coding session. This is where you have time to work on the project live with one of the engineers on the team. They ask you questions about your solution and may provide hints when you get stuck. For either one, you'll need to prepare in advance. How do you do that? Research the technologies that your desired team uses. Write down notes about the pros and cons. Then put those technologies into practice. This could be in a side project or some other means. 

And to boost your problem-solving skills, you can turn to online websites, such as LeetCode and AlgoExpert. They provide exercises that you're likely to encounter during your tech interview. This is especially applicable to any algorithm questions. As a heads up, many companies will have you add a new feature to their application as part of the tech challenge. So it's a good idea to make sure you've used their product before the interview. For example:

A music app might have you build a new filter for their list of song screen. If you've used their app already, you'll feel more confident about your approach and ultimate solution. And to really stand out, make sure you can discuss your proposed solution. Being able to effectively share your thought process will give the interviewer insight into how you approach problems. Communicating effectively is a timeless skill that is welcomed on any software team.

How to be successful starting out

With each new role, I ask myself, do I have what it takes? Can I really be successful here? Maybe you're wondering the same. If so, you're not alone. It's natural to be apprehensive, nervous even, about starting out in your programming career. I want you to succeed, so I'm going to share with you three tips that have helped me to overcome my self doubts. 

First, be curious. As you've seen, there's a lot to learn when it comes to the tech industry. Being curious will provide the drive needed to find answers when you get stuck. It will help you find joy in exploring new technologies and ways of working as they come along. Curiosity will keep you from being stagnant, and eventually obsolete as a programmer. 

Second, take time to practice. Think back to when you were a kid. Did you tie your shoes perfectly the first time? Of course not. You had to do it again, and again, and again. Then that one day you had a perfect bow. It's the same way with programming. You will need to practice your skills again and again, then one day it will click and you'll have your perfect bow, so to speak. 

Finally, and most importantly, don't do it alone. Throughout this course, you've seen that software development is a team endeavor. To accelerate your growth, you'll want to invest in a strong network of your peers. I remember learning to code in college. I had to work all alone, but it's not like that in the real world. You can and should collaborate openly with others and ask for help when needed. Choosing this career was one of the best decisions of my life. Although the road to success can be bumpy and long, you can get there, 

Just don't give up.
